The message indicates that the user has already consulted the documentation but is still unable to perform the desired action. This suggests that the issue is related to the product's features and user interface, making it most appropriate to route this ticket to the product support team.\n","\n","\n","Selected route: product\n","\n","\n","Product Support Response:\n","Certainly, Mike! Exporting your project data to Excel is a straightforward process, and I'm glad to guide you through it. This feature is particularly useful for detailed analysis or sharing data with team members who might not have access to our platform.\n","\n","### Steps to Export Project Data to Excel:\n","\n","1. **Navigate to the Project Overview:**\n","   - Log in to your account and go to the project you want to export data from.\n","   - Click on the project name to open the project overview page.\n","\n","2. **Access the Data Export Section:**\n","   - On the project overview page, look for the \"Data\" or \"Data Management\" tab. This is usually located in the top menu or sidebar.\n","   - Click on the \"Data\" tab to access the data management section.\n","\n","3. **Select the Data to Export:**\n","   - In the data management section, you will see a list of all the data entries or datasets.\n","   - Use the checkboxes to select the specific data entries you want to export. If you need to export all data, you can usually click a \"Select All\" button.\n","\n","4. **Initiate the Export:**\n","   - Once you have selected the data, look for an \"Export\" or \"Download\" button. This is typically located at the top of the data list or in the action menu.\n","   - Click the \"Export\" button. You will be prompted to choose the export format. Select \"Excel\" from the options.\n","\n","5. **Download the File:**\n","   - After selecting the format, the system will prepare your file. This might take a few moments, depending on the size of the data.\n","   - Once the file is ready, you will be prompted to download it. Save the file to your desired location on your computer.\n","\n","### Additional Tips:\n","- **Customize Your Export:**\n","  - Before exporting, you can customize the data fields that are included in the export. This can be done by selecting or deselecting specific columns in the data management section.\n","  - For example, if you only need certain metrics or attributes, you can uncheck the others to keep your Excel file more focused.\n","\n","- **Regular Backups:**\n","  - Consider setting up regular data exports as part of your project management routine. This ensures you always have the latest data available for offline analysis or backups.\n","\n","### Related Features:\n","- **Data Filters:**\n","  - If you need to export data based on specific criteria, you can use the data filters to narrow down your selection before exporting. This is especially useful for large datasets.\n","  - For more information on using filters, check out our [Data Management Guide](https://example.com/data-management-guide).\n","\n","- **Automated Reports:**\n","  - If you frequently need to share data with stakeholders, consider setting up automated reports. These can be scheduled to run at regular intervals and sent directly to your email or a shared drive.\n","  - Learn more about automated reports in our [Reporting Section](https://example.com/reporting-section).\n","\n","I hope this helps, Mike!

The use of two stacks, one to store all elements and another to keep track of the minimum element, is a common and efficient approach. The code follows good style and best practices, with clear method names, appropriate use of conditionals, and handling of edge cases (such as popping from an empty stack).\n","\n","However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made:\n","1. Add docstrings to the class and methods to provide better documentation and understanding of the code.\n","2.

Use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability (e.g., `top` could be renamed to `popped_element`).\n","\n","These suggestions would enhance the code's maintainability and readability without affecting its correctness or performance.\n","\n","=== EVALUATION END ===\n","\n"]}]}]}
