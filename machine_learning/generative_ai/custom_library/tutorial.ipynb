Below is an example SQL query that demonstrates the use of JOIN, HAVING, and PARTITION BY clauses. This example assumes we are working with a database that supports window functions (like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle). The scenario is a hypothetical sales database where we want to find the total sales per product category for each region, but only include those categories where the total sales exceed a certain threshold, and partition the results by region.\n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT \n","    region,\n","    product_category,\n","    SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS total_sales_per_region,\n","    SUM(sales_amount) AS sales_per_category\n","FROM \n","    sales\n","JOIN \n","    products ON sales.product_id = products.product_id\n","GROUP BY \n","    region, product_category\n","HAVING \n","    SUM(sales_amount) > 10000\n","ORDER BY \n","    region, sales_per_category DESC;\n","```\n","\n","Here's a breakdown of the query:\n","\n","1. **JOIN**: We're joining the `sales` table with the `products` table on the `product_id` to get the product categories for each sale.\n","\n","2. **GROUP BY**: We're grouping the results by `region` and `product_category` to calculate the total sales per category within each region.\n","\n","3. **SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY region)**: This is a window function that calculates the total sales per region without collapsing the rows into a single row per region (which would be the case with a simple SUM() function). It allows us to keep the individual sales per category alongside the total sales per region.\n","\n","4. **HAVING**: This clause is used to filter the grouped results to only include those where the total sales per category exceed 10,000. Note that in this context, `HAVING` is used after the `GROUP BY` clause to filter aggregated results.\n","\n","5. **ORDER BY**: Finally, we're ordering the results by `region` and then by `sales_per_category` in descending order to make it easier to identify the top-performing categories within each region.\n","\n","Please note that the exact syntax and capabilities can vary depending on the SQL database you're using.
