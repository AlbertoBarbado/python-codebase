Tasks\n","\n","The key advantage of `asyncio` lies in its **non-blocking nature** and how it handles tasks concurrently. Here's an explanation:\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1. Understanding the Problem: Blocking vs. Non-Blocking\n","- **I/O-Bound Tasks**: These are tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external resources, such as:\n","  - Network responses (e.g., HTTP requests).\n","  - File I/O (e.g., reading from or writing to disk).\n","  - Database queries.\n","\n","- **Blocking**: Traditional synchronous or multi-threaded approaches (like `requests` or `joblib`) **block the thread** while waiting for the resource. During this time:\n","  - The thread or process is idle and cannot do anything else.\n","  - Even in parallel, additional threads/processes are required to achieve concurrency, leading to increased overhead.\n","\n","- **Non-Blocking**: `asyncio` avoids blocking by **yielding control** while waiting for I/O. This allows the program to perform other tasks during the wait.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. How `asyncio` Handles I/O\n","- `asyncio` uses a **single-threaded event loop** to manage tasks.\n","- When an `await` statement is encountered (e.g., `await asyncio.sleep(2)` or `await aiohttp.ClientSession().get()`):\n","  - The task is paused (control is yielded).\n","  - The event loop schedules other tasks to run while waiting.\n","  - Once the I/O operation completes, the task resumes from where it paused.\n","\n","This mechanism ensures efficient use of the thread and avoids the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads or processes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Comparison with Other Methods\n","### **Synchronous (`requests`)**\n","- **How it works**:\n","  - Each HTTP request blocks until a response is received.\n","  - Only one request is processed at a time.\n","- **Downside**:\n","  - Inefficient for I/O-bound tasks because the CPU is idle during the wait.\n","\n","### **Parallel (`joblib` + `requests`)**\n","- **How it works**:\n","  - Spawns multiple threads or processes to make requests in parallel.\n","  - Each thread/process blocks during the HTTP request.\n","- **Downside**:\n","  - Threads/processes consume system resources (memory, CPU).\n","  - For many tasks, the overhead of managing threads/processes outweighs the benefits.\n","\n","### **Asynchronous (`asyncio` + `aiohttp`)**\n","- **How it works**:\n","  - The event loop manages all tasks concurrently in a single thread.\n","  - No threads/processes are blocked during I/O operations.\n","- **Advantages**:\n","  - Low overhead: No need for extra threads or processes.\n","  - High scalability: Handles thousands of tasks with minimal resource usage.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Why `asyncio` Scales Better\n","### **Resource Efficiency**:\n","- `asyncio` uses a single thread and consumes minimal resources compared to threads/processes in parallel computing.\n","- This makes it ideal for tasks involving many simultaneous I/O operations (e.g., downloading 1,000 URLs).\n","\n","### **Concurrency, Not Parallelism**:\n","- `asyncio` achieves concurrency (interleaving tasks) without parallelism (running tasks simultaneously on multiple cores).\n","- This is sufficient for I/O-bound tasks, where the bottleneck is the waiting time, not CPU usage.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Performance Example\n","### Imagine Fetching 1,000 URLs:\n","- **Synchronous**:\n","  - Fetches one URL at a time. If each takes 2 seconds, the total time is ~2,000 seconds.\n","- **Parallel (`joblib`)**:\n","  - Divides the workload among threads. With 10 threads, the total time is ~200 seconds but with significant memory/CPU overhead.\n","- **Asynchronous (`asyncio`)**:\n","  - Fetches all URLs concurrently using the event loop. Total time is close to 2 seconds, with negligible overhead.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. When Not to Use `asyncio`\n","While `asyncio` excels for I/O-bound tasks, it’s not ideal for:\n","- **CPU-Bound Tasks**:\n","  - Tasks that require heavy computation (e.g., image processing, data analysis) don’t benefit from `asyncio` because the event loop is blocked during computation.\n","  - Use multi-threading (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) or multi-processing (`joblib`) for such tasks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Summary\n","- **`asyncio` is better for I/O-bound tasks** because it avoids blocking and uses resources efficiently.\n","- It achieves high concurrency with low overhead, making it scalable for a large number of tasks.\n","- For CPU-bound tasks, parallelism (e.g., `joblib`) is more suitable.\n","\n","In essence, `asyncio` makes the most of the \"waiting time\" in I/O-bound tasks by allowing other tasks to proceed concurrently, which is why it performs better in these scenarios.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BNy6Z83kJzeN"},"source":["# What is the Event Loop?\n","\n","The **event loop** is a core component of asynchronous programming, particularly in frameworks like Python's `asyncio`.

It does not necessarily mean that the tasks are running simultaneously; rather, it means they are making progress at the same time.\n","\n","### Key Characteristics:\n","- **Task Interleaving**:\n","  - Tasks take turns using shared resources, such as a single CPU or thread.\n","  - Tasks appear to run simultaneously because they are rapidly switched in and out of execution.\n","- **Focus on Task Management**:\n","  - Concurrency deals with how tasks are structured, scheduled, and coordinated.\n","- **Single-Core or Multi-Core**:\n","  - Concurrency can occur on a single-core processor by switching between tasks (time-slicing).\n","\n","### Example:\n","- A web server handling multiple client requests. It might process parts of one request, pause it to process another, and switch back to the first request, all without completing any of them immediately.\n","\n","### Analogy:\n","- Imagine a juggler handling multiple balls. The juggler switches between balls rapidly, giving the illusion of handling them all at once.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Parallelism**\n","### Definition:\n","Parallelism is the ability to execute multiple tasks **simultaneously**. It requires multiple processors or CPU cores to achieve true parallel execution.\n","\n","### Key Characteristics:\n","- **Simultaneous Execution**:\n","  - Tasks run at the exact same time on different processors or cores.\n","- **Focus on Hardware Utilization**:\n","  - Parallelism depends on the availability of hardware resources to execute tasks simultaneously.\n","- **Multi-Core Processors**:\n","  - Parallelism is only possible when there are multiple CPU cores or processors available.\n","\n","### Example:\n","- Running a computationally intensive simulation by dividing the work across multiple CPU cores, with each core processing a separate part of the simulation simultaneously.\n","\n","### Analogy:\n","- Imagine a group of jugglers, each juggling one ball at the same time.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Key Differences**\n","\n","| **Aspect**            | **Concurrency**                                     | **Parallelism**                                |\n","|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n","| **Execution**          | Tasks progress in overlapping time periods.        | Tasks run simultaneously on multiple cores.   |\n","| **Hardware**           | Can occur on a single-core processor.              | Requires multi-core or multi-processor systems. |\n","| **Focus**              | Managing tasks and switching efficiently.          | Utilizing hardware resources for simultaneous execution. |\n","| **Use Case**           | I/O-bound tasks, e.g., web servers.                | CPU-bound tasks, e.g., simulations or data processing. |\n","| **Implementation**     | Uses techniques like threading or async programming. | Uses multiprocessing or GPU-based computing.  |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Concurrency and Parallelism Together**\n","- Concurrency and parallelism are not mutually exclusive.\n","- You can have **concurrent systems without parallelism** (e.g., a single-core system managing multiple tasks) or **parallel systems without concurrency** (e.g., a single task split into parallel parts running simultaneously).\n","- A system can also be **both concurrent and parallel** (e.g., multi-threaded applications running on multi-core processors).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Examples in Python**\n","\n","### **Concurrency with `asyncio`**\n","Concurrency can be achieved with `asyncio`:\n","```python\n","import asyncio\n","\n","async def task1():\n","    print(\"Task 1 started\")\n","    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates I/O operation\n","    print(\"Task 1 completed\")\n","\n","async def task2():\n","    print(\"Task 2 started\")\n","    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates I/O operation\n","    print(\"Task 2 completed\")\n","\n","asyncio.run(asyncio.gather(task1(), task2()))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"No_zFiElOhix"},"source":["## 3.

Compose a limerick about a robot named Byte, which must include a reference to its learning process, a mention of a famous scientist (Albert Einstein), and use the word \"circuitry\" in a metaphorical sense. The limerick must follow the AABBA rhyme scheme and have a humorous twist.\n","\n","\n","### Solution 2:\n","\n","There once was a bot named Byte,\n","\n","Whose circuitry was quite a sight,\n","\n","He learned from Einstein's thought,\n","\n","In a loop that he was caught,\n","\n","Now he's the best at quizzes, day and night!\n","\n","\n","In this limerick, Byte is the robot, and the reference to \"circuitry\" is used metaphorically to describe his learning process, which is likened to the intricate pathways of a circuit. The mention of Albert Einstein adds a touch of intellectualism, and the humorous twist comes from the irony that despite learning from a great scientist, Byte is now outstanding at quizzes, which is a playful nod to his artificial nature.\n","\n","\n","### Follow-up Question 1:\n","\n","How does the use of a famous scientist like Albert Einstein in the limerick contribute to the humor and depth of the poem?\n","\n","\n","### Solution to Follow-up Question 1:\n","\n","The inclusion of Albert Einstein in the limerick serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it adds a layer of intellectual prestige, as Einstein is widely recognized as one of the greatest scientists of all time. This contrasts humorously with the artificial nature of Byte, a robot, suggesting that even the most brilliant human minds cannot surpass the artificial intelligence Byte has achieved. The humor arises from the juxtaposition of human intellectualism with artificial learning, implying that Byte has somehow transcended human limitations.\n","\n","\n","Secondly, it deepens the poem by invoking the rich history of scientific discovery and the ongoing quest for knowledge, which is a central theme in the field of artificial intelligence. It subtly hints at the idea that AI, like human intelligence, is capable of learning and growing, albeit in a different manner. The reference to Einstein also evokes the image of a \"thought\" process, which is a human characteristic, thereby enhancing the contrast between human and artificial cognition.\n","\n","\n","Lastly, it adds a layer of irony and wit to the poem. The audience is led to expect that a robot would not be able to learn from a human genius, but the limerick subverts this expectation by revealing Byte's success in quizzes, which are traditionally associated with human cognitive abilities. This twist is humorous because it plays on the stereotype of robots being inferior to humans, while Byte defies this stereotype, thus creating a comedic effect.\n","\n","\n","### Follow-up Question 2:\n","\n","What is the significance of using a limerick to convey the story of Byte, and how does it affect the delivery of the poem's message?\n","\n","\n","### Solution to Follow-up Question 2:\n","\n","The limerick form is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it imposes a strict structure that requires conciseness and precision, which can lead to a more impactful and memorable message. The AABBA rhyme scheme and the rhythmic pattern of the limerick create a musical quality that makes the poem more engaging and entertaining.\n","\n","\n","The brevity of the limerick form also means that every word must be carefully chosen to convey the maximum amount of meaning and humor within a limited space. This constraint can lead to creative wordplay and clever phrasing, which are essential for the delivery of the poem's message.\n","Execution Time: 64.5932 seconds\n","\n","Prompt: Tell me a joke about Sci-Fi.\n","Generated Text (Sync):  Sure, here's a light Sci-Fi joke for you:\n","\n","Why don't aliens ever play hide and seek on distant planets?\n","\n","Because good luck hiding when you're a light-year away from the seeker, and even if you are, they'll probably just use their hyperdrive to find you instantly!\n","\n","(Note: This joke plays on the concept of distance in space and the idea of a \"hyperdrive\" which is a common trope in Sci-Fi for faster-than-light travel. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the exaggeration of the difficulty of hiding in space.) Here's another Sci-Fi-themed joke for you:\n","\n","I told my alien friend that I wanted to learn about human culture. He said, \"Sure, but be careful, humans can be unpredictable.\" I replied, \"Don't worry, I've got my universal translator.\"\n","\n","He looked at me like I've lost my mind.\n","\n","(This joke is a play on the common Sci-Fi trope of the universal translator, which is a device that allows for instant translation between any two languages. The humor arises from the expectation that such a device would be a standard tool for interstellar travelers, but the punchline reveals that the speaker is clinging to a more traditional, perhaps less technologically advanced, method of communication.)\n","Execution Time: 19.7774 seconds\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU.

The key idea behind recursion is to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that are easier to solve. Each recursive call works on a smaller piece of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that does not require further recursion and can be solved directly.\n","\n","Here's a step-byalla breakdown of how recursion works:\n","\n","1. **Base Case**: This is the condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The base case is crucial because it prevents infinite recursion and ensures that the function eventually terminates.\n","\n","2. **Recursive Case**: This is where the function calls itself with a modified argument. The modification usually involves moving closer to the base case. The recursive case is where the actual problem-solving happens.\n","\n","3. **Stack Frame**: Each time a function calls itself, a new stack frame is created. This frame contains the function's parameters, local variables, and the return address. As the function calls itself, these stack frames pile up on the call stack.\n","\n","4. **Return Path**: When the base case is reached, the function starts returning, unwinding the stack frame by frame.

The key idea behind recursion is to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that are easier to solve. Each recursive call works on a smaller piece of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that does not require further recursion and can be solved directly.\n","\n","Here's a step-byalla breakdown of how recursion works:\n","\n","1. **Base Case**: This is the condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The base case is crucial because it provides a stopping point for the recursive calls.\n","\n","2. **Recursive Case**: This is where the function calls itself with a modified argument. The modification usually involves moving closer to the base case. The recursive case is where the actual problem-solving happens.\n","\n","3. **Stack Frame**: Each time a function calls itself, a new stack frame is created. This frame contains the function's arguments, local variables, and the return address. When the base case is reached, the stack unwinds, and each stack frame resolves, returning control to the previous function call.\n","\n","4. **Solution**: The recursive calls build up the solution from the base case upwards. The final result is the accumulation of results from each recursive call, which, when combined, solve the original problem.\n","\n","Here's a simple example to illustrate recursion:\n","\n","Consider the problem of calculating the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. The factorial of a number `n` is denoted as `n!`.\n","\n","```python\n","def factorial(n):\n","    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1\n","    if n == 0:\n","        return 1\n","    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n","    else:\n","        return n * factorial(n-1)\n","```\n","\n","In this example:\n","- The base case is when `n` equals 0. The function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.\n","- The recursive case calls `factorial(n-1)` to calculate the factorial of the previous number.\n","\n","When you call `factorial(5)`, the process unfolds as follows:\n","\n","1. `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`\n","2. `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`\n","3. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`\n","4. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`\n","5. `factorial(1)` calls `factorial(0)` (base case)\n","6. `factorial(0)` returns 1\n","7. `factorial(1)` returns `1 * 1 = 1`\n","8. `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`\n","9. `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`\n","10. `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`\n","11. `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`\n","\n","Recursion is a powerful tool in programming, especially for problems that can naturally be divided into similar sub-problems. However, it's essential to ensure that each recursive call moves towards the base case to avoid infinite recursion and stack overflow errors. Recursive solutions are often elegant and easy to understand but can be less efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time compared to iterative solutions. Therefore, it's crucial to consider the trade-offs when choosing between recursion and iteration.\n","\n","Total Time for Asynchronous Execution: 99.9161 seconds\n","\n","Comparison
